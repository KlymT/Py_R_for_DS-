cuteness. He is energetic and playful. I rescued a couple of cats a few months ago but could not get them neutered in time as the clinic was fully scheduled. The result was this little kitty.

She is very quiet and only meows very rarely. She likes to cuddle when she is sleepy and also when she wakes up from a nap. As long as she has her toys, she keeps herself active and busy during the day. Would recommend you spend at least half an hour every night to play with her as it is her normal routine now. Would recommend that you house her alone as a single cat or with another kitten. She has had her second vaccination and deworming and needs another one next month. Serious adopters only please.

Please call if you can give her a home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n","25    hello cikenets fans, i just wanna inform that cikenet is not lost, i just found out that he is adopted by one of this apartment resident, he become an indoor cat now, he is in good hands and im happy for him..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n","26    Garfield is a very large cat.

And the adopter must take the kitten to vaccination (start from 2 months old) and neuter (at 6 months old).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n","⋮     ⋮                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n","14964 Pls adopt this cat, mix maincoone, so active...i have to let go bcause so busy lately....cod at putrajaya...do call or whatapps me if interested...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n","14965 He's lovely, calm, friendly, quiet, sweet, intelligent and playful.

This helps us to feed the strays and so we're able to help more homeless animals. *** It's a MUST for adopter to bring adopted pet for vaccinations and NEUTER/SPAYING surgery because we don't want them to give birth to more homeless souls to this world again like their mother. TQ***  Lately we met with this mother cat named Mami with a very big tummy,obviously she was at late stage of pregnancy. We offered her foods and she gave birth last month at a gym's staircase, we only managed to find her babies after some times. 3babies are very adorable and had flu last week but after oral medications is now recovered. Owner of gym told us that they're forced to release them to street when they grow older. All babies are afraid of strangers but after some times they will be friendly with you. We really really hope to get them a home ASAP before the owner release them out to street..they definitely deserve a good home :( Interested to adopt?

She is very quiet and only meows very rarely. She likes to cuddle when she is sleepy and also when she wakes up from a nap. As long as she has her toys, she keeps herself active and busy during the day. Would recommend you spend at least half an hour every night to play with her as it is her normal routine now. Would recommend that you house her alone as a single cat or with another kitten. She has had her second vaccination and deworming and needs another one next month. Serious adopters only please.

Stay there and keep meowing. Kitty like to follow human feet. When we stand still, kitty just lean on our feed and sit quietly. Only for indoor adoption. And the adopter must take the kitten to vaccination (start from 2 months old) and neuter (at 6 months old).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 & d341fbfd6 &  1 & 2\\\\\n\t ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋱ & ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋮\\\\\n\t 2 & Boceyyy                             &  6 & 276 &   0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 2 & ⋯ & 1 & 1 & 50 & 41326 & 966c41ae3a2427fd7882e899525f8b4e & 0 & Pls adopt this cat, mix maincoone, so active...i have to let go bcause so busy lately....cod at putrajaya...do call or whatapps me if interested...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & 3b3b37546 &  2 & 1\\\\\n\t 2 & Panbe                               & 36 & 265 &   0 & 1 & 6 & 7 & 0 & 2 & ⋯ & 1 & 1 &  0 & 41401 & fbd0f7634f117795c5b9e8315f439015 & 0 & He's lovely, calm, friendly, quiet, sweet, intelligent and playful.

It would be very pity to roam around without proper care. I hope they can be adopted and be taken good care of.

Love pampering, purring and laying down the instance you stroke his neck. Love to chase flying insects or lounge on a stool. Scared of strangers, will hide in a corner or under the sofa.

This helps us to feed the strays and so we're able to help more homeless animals. *** It's a MUST for adopter to bring adopted pet for vaccinations and NEUTER/SPAYING surgery because we don't want them to give birth to more homeless souls to this world again like their mother. TQ***  Lately we met with this mother cat named Mami with a very big tummy,obviously she was at late stage of pregnancy. We offered her foods and she gave birth last month at a gym's staircase, we only managed to find her babies after some times. 3babies are very adorable and had flu last week but after oral medications is now recovered. Owner of gym told us that they're forced to release them to street when they grow older. All babies are afraid of strangers but after some times they will be friendly with you. We really really hope to get them a home ASAP before the owner release them out to street..they definitely deserve a good home :( Interested to adopt?

It about 1 1/2 months old. My cat got pregnant before we got the chance to get its muted. The kittens are healthy and are eating kittens biscuits now.

He is energetic and playful. I rescued a couple of cats a few months ago but could not get them neutered in time as the clinic was fully scheduled. The result was this little kitty.

She is very quiet and only meows very rarely. She likes to cuddle when she is sleepy and also when she wakes up from a nap. As long as she has her toys, she keeps herself active and busy during the day. Would recommend you spend at least half an hour every night to play with her as it is her normal routine now. Would recommend that you house her alone as a single cat or with another kitten. She has had her second vaccination and deworming and needs another one next month. Serious adopters only please. Looking for a good forever home for Kali.

This is my first posting and I need help! 3 months ago we befriended a mother stray cat with 3 kittens in our area and we 'adopted' them but they come and go as they please. 2 months ago the mother gave birth to a litter of 7 cute kittens and we have been taking care of the mother and the kittens ever since in our home...in the ground floor bathroom! Some of the kittens look half-persian with long hair,evident also from the earlier stray batch we adopted. Looking for good caring homes...                                                                                                                                                                              | 4a9793dfb |  1 | 1 |\n| 1 | Lost Dog                          |  3 | 307 |   0 | 2 | 2 | 5 | 7 | 2 | ⋯ | 1 |  1 |   0 | 41401 | b609c40c6c840db208b149a19b856f86 | 0 | Lost Dog Found (Bandar Menjalara, Kepong／Taman Bukit Maluri or Desa Park City) 迷途犬被尋獲 (甲洞孟加拉惹／武吉馬魯里／Desa Park City) Area lost puppy found 小狗被發現地點：Bandar Sri Menjalara, Kepong, KL, Malaysia 大馬吉隆坡甲洞孟加拉惹 How the lost dog found 狗兒如何被發現: The lost puppy entered my staying place itself. 迷途小狗自行進我居住地。 Condition 情況: 雖好像幾天沒進食。看起來健康。頸上系有紅帶。目前甲洞孟加拉惹住宅區保安處看顧。Few days without food.

Stay there and keep meowing. Kitty like to follow human feet. When we stand still, kitty just lean on our feed and sit quietly. Only for indoor adoption. And the adopter must take the kitten to vaccination (start from 2 months old) and neuter (at 6 months old).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | d341fbfd6 |  1 | 2 |\n| ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋱ | ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ |\n| 2 | Boceyyy                             |  6 | 276 |   0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | ⋯ | 1 | 1 | 50 | 41326 | 966c41ae3a2427fd7882e899525f8b4e | 0 | Pls adopt this cat, mix maincoone, so active...i have to let go bcause so busy lately....cod at putrajaya...do call or whatapps me if interested...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 3b3b37546 |  2 | 1 |\n| 2 | Panbe                               | 36 | 265 |   0 | 1 | 6 | 7 | 0 | 2 | ⋯ | 1 | 1 |  0 | 41401 | fbd0f7634f117795c5b9e8315f439015 | 0 | He's lovely, calm, friendly, quiet, sweet, intelligent and playful.

It would be very pity to roam around without proper care. I hope they can be adopted and be taken good care of. Anyone interested kindly PM me yeah :) Kindly help to share this post. *Four out of six puppies have been successfully adopted. We only left these two puppies. *For SERIOUS adopter only.

Love pampering, purring and laying down the instance you stroke his neck. Love to chase flying insects or lounge on a stool. Scared of strangers, will hide in a corner or under the sofa.

This helps us to feed the strays and so we're able to help more homeless animals. *** It's a MUST for adopter to bring adopted pet for vaccinations and NEUTER/SPAYING surgery because we don't want them to give birth to more homeless souls to this world again like their mother. TQ***  Lately we met with this mother cat named Mami with a very big tummy,obviously she was at late stage of pregnancy. We offered her foods and she gave birth last month at a gym's staircase, we only managed to find her babies after some times. 3babies are very adorable and had flu last week but after oral medications is now recovered. Owner of gym told us that they're forced to release them to street when they grow older. All babies are afraid of strangers but after some times they will be friendly with you. We really really hope to get them a home ASAP before the owner release them out to street..they definitely deserve a good home :( Interested to adopt?

It about 1 1/2 months old. My cat got pregnant before we got the chance to get its muted. The kittens are healthy and are eating kittens biscuits now.

He is energetic and playful. I rescued a couple of cats a few months ago but could not get them neutered in time as the clinic was fully scheduled. The result was this little kitty. I do not have enough space and funds to care for more cats in my household. Looking for responsible people to take over Nibble's care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td><td>86e1089a3</td><td> 1</td><td>2</td></tr>\n","\t<tr><td>2</td><td>No Name Yet                      </td><td> 1</td><td>265</td><td>  0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>⋯</td><td>1</td><td> 1</td><td>  0</td><td>41401</td><td>3082c7125d8fb66f7dd4bff4192c8b14</td><td>0</td><td>I just found it alone yesterday near my apartment.

She is very quiet and only meows very rarely. She likes to cuddle when she is sleepy and also when she wakes up from a nap. As long as she has her toys, she keeps herself active and busy during the day. Would recommend you spend at least half an hour every night to play with her as it is her normal routine now. Would recommend that you house her alone as a single cat or with another kitten. She has had her second vaccination and deworming and needs another one next month. Serious adopters only please.

TQ***  Lately we met with this mother cat named Mami with a very big tummy,obviously she was at late stage of pregnancy. We offered her foods and she gave birth last month at a gym's staircase, we only managed to find her babies after some times. 3babies are very adorable and had flu last week but after oral medications is now recovered. Owner of gym told us that they're forced to release them to street when they grow older. All babies are afraid of strangers but after some times they will be friendly with you. We really really hope to get them a home ASAP before the owner release them out to street..they definitely deserve a good home :( Interested to adopt? We wish adopter would agree to do so.. - Always keep cat indoor all the time - Spay them when they're about 6months old - Agree to bring adopted pet for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat adopted pet like your own precious family members Please give a home to them ♥</td><td>54b6c1d72</td><td>16</td><td>3</td></tr>\n","\t<tr><td>1</td><td>Alger                              </td><td> 3</td><td>307</td><td>  0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>2</td><td>⋯</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td> 0</td><td>41326</td><td>fa90fa5b1ee11c86938398b60abc32cb</td><td>0</td><td>He is very intelligent and cute.
